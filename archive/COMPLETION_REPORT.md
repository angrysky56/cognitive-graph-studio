## Completion Report

This report summarizes the tasks completed to integrate the enhanced graph functionality and AI capabilities into the Cognitive Graph Studio application.

### Completed Tasks:

-   **Refactored `App.tsx` to use `enhancedGraphStore`:** The main application component now utilizes the more robust `enhancedGraphStore` for state management, enabling advanced AI features.
-   **Integrated `EnhancedDocumentImporter` into `App.tsx`:** The document import functionality now uses the `EnhancedDocumentImporter`, which performs semantic processing and intelligent entity/relationship extraction.
-   **Wired up the `GraphEngine`:** All core graph operations (node/edge creation, updates, deletions) are now handled by the `GraphEngine`, ensuring consistent data processing and AI integration.
-   **Implemented the `linking-agent`:** The `linking-agent` is now active and automatically suggests and creates connections between nodes based on semantic similarity after a new node is added.
-   **Implemented the `critique-agent`:** The `critique-agent` is now active and provides feedback on graph quality and suggests improvements after node updates.
-   **Updated `GraphCanvas.tsx` to support `EnhancedGraphNode` and `EnhancedGraphEdge`:** `GraphCanvas.tsx` now uses the enhanced types.
-   **Created a unified data model:** All relevant components and services now consistently use the types defined in `src/types/enhanced-graph.ts`, ensuring data integrity and compatibility across the application.
-   **Removed redundant code:** The deprecated `graphStore.ts` and `main.tsx.backup` files have been removed, streamlining the codebase.
-   **Fixed AI Chat Functionality:** Ensured AI-driven node creation and editing via chat are correctly wired up and handle `richContent.markdown` properly.
-   **Improved Graph Presentation:** Replaced the D3.js-based `GraphCanvas.tsx` with the React Flow-based `MyGraphCanvas.tsx` from the `archive/components` folder, and updated it to use `EnhancedGraphNode` and `EnhancedGraphEdge` types.
-   **Made Side Panels Expandable:** Implemented resizing functionality for the left and right side panels in `App.tsx`.

### Next Steps:

-   **Verify application functionality:** Thoroughly test the application to ensure all features work as expected with the new architecture.
-   **Further AI agent integration:** Explore opportunities to integrate other AI agents (e.g., summarization, workflow) into the application's core logic.
-   **Performance optimization:** Monitor and optimize the performance of AI operations and graph rendering, especially with large datasets.
-   **User experience improvements:** Enhance the UI/UX based on user feedback and further integration of AI insights.
