## ðŸš€ Ready for Production Use

### **Immediate Testing**
```bash
cd /home/ty/Repositories/ai_workspace/cognitive-graph-studio
npm run dev

# Browser console:
import { runDemo } from './src/demo/cognitive-graph-demo'
await runDemo()
```

### **Integration Example**
```typescript
import { initializeServices, getCognitiveGraphService } from './src/services/service-manager'

// Initialize with API keys
await initializeServices({
  credentials: { geminiApiKey: 'your-key-here' }
})

// Use enhanced capabilities
const cognitive = getCognitiveGraphService()
const result = await cognitive.executeEnhancedQuery({
  query: 'Analyze the relationship between quantum computing and AI',
  type: 'reasoning',
  reasoning: { depth: 3, timeLimit: 20, useMultiModel: true }
})
```
